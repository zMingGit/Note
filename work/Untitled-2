一个牙齿流汗的疯子瞪得我心嘭嘭直跳.
他伸出手掐我脖子.
他一直在念叨.
念叨着真理，真理就象一床总让你双脚冰冷的毯子.
你怎么扯，怎么拽总也不够，踢也好，打也好，它总盖不住我们.
从我们哭着降生到我们奄奄一息.
它只会盖住你的脸，不管你如何痛苦 如何叫喊.

A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
His hands reach out and choke me.
And all the time he's mumbling.
Mumbling trush.
Trush is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.You push it,stretch it,
it'll never be enough,You kick at it, beat it, it'll never conver any of us.
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying.
it'll just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream.
