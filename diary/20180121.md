this week, i have look three chapetrs of flush python,and  a lot of time used for work, it's tired.
Now i'm need to learn the several files storage system, like s3, switch and ceph.Because need to write unit test for Seafobj project.  i think it's nice. 

I don't know why so unhappy. Maybe in recent weeks, so many BUG let me to tired or  is didn't go out to breathe fresh air.  this week i didn't learn more algorithm.

so, i play the game to release myself,  try to make myself happy.this game named 荒野求生, and until get 1 st in this game.Then sleep on sunday 5 clock, wake up at 12 clock. Then I still don't want to write code, nor look the book i didn't finish watch.
