  This week i have two day for rest. Alouth the rest time has increased,but i did not use it to study or to release my heart.
In recent days, i am watching Naruto mange. A full chapter more than 700, i finished reading a weak, i feel great. 

  Now i'm ready to adjust my status and start learning and finishing things i planned well before. Finally, my mood is much better than last week, And until today, before the legs are not very comfortable, feel a lot better now.
